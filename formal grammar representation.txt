This isn't backus-naur, because i can't be bothered to learn it now

program -> (declaration | linebreak)* EOF

linebreak -> ("\n")*

declaration -> classDecl | rouDecl | varDecl | statement 

classDecl -> "class" IDENTIFIER ( "<" IDENTIFIER)? "{" linebreak routine* linebreak "}"

rouDecl -> "routine" routine
routine -> IDENTIFIER "(" linebreak? parameters? linebreak?")" linebreak? block
parameters -> IDENTIFIER ( "," linebreak? IDENTIFIER)*

varDecl -> "let" IDENTIFIER ("(" linebreak? parameters linebreak? ")")? ( "=" linebreak? expression)? delimitator

statement -> exprStmt | forStmt | ifStmt | printStmt | returnStmt | whileStmt | block| directive

directive -> '#' directiveName '\n'?

directiveName -> a directive name is composed of anything that isn't whitespace. There is probably a simple way of expressing this in regEx, but i unforgivably don't know how to use them.
basically, if it can be a twitter hashtag, it counts

these should be interpreted the following way: in order to build a valid BetaScript expression, one starts at the expression rule, and
them follows the rule set in order to build it, going down.

"expression -> equality" means "in order to build an expression, use the equality rule"

equality -> comparison ( "==" comparison )* means "in order to build an equality, use a comparison rule followed by any number of '==' tokens followed by more comparisons"
this also means equality is left-associative, which means that, in a chain of equalities, the left-most equality is evaluated first.

a == b == c == d is evaluated as (((a == b) == c) == d) 

looking at the wy the expression is written, one may think it's the other way around, but it is actually written that way to avoid recursion.
In the recursive form, more intuitive, it reads as equality -> equality ("==" comparison)? (where ? means "may happen one or zero times"),
and it is more apparent that the left-most operand is nested deeper, and thus evaluated first.

The parse function simply follows the ruleset defined above, by calling methods which emulate each rule.

Since evaluating a AST begins at the leaves, the lowest precedence rule is the one which is called first, so that they are nested upwards in the tree
